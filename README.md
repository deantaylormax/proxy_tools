# proxy lst generator

This tool grabs a list of proxies and puts them into a python list.  From that list you can select any of the proxies to then add to your code.
This code is nearly instantaneous (depending on your Interrnet connection) so you could theortetically have it run every time you accessed a website.

# proxy csv creator and puller

this code creates a csv of proxies that have been tested against http bin for their viability.  It then has a second function which you can include in your code
to randomly (or in order) access those proxies from that csv to use in your code, e.g. selenium proxy setting in webdriver options.
